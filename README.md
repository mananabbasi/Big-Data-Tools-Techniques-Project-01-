Every row in the dataset corresponds to an individual clinical trial and is identified  by different variables. It's important to note that the first column contains a mixture  of various variables separated by a delimiter, and the date columns exhibit various  formats. Please consider these issues and ensure that the dataset is appropriately .

2. pharma.csv:
The file contains a small number of a publicly available list of pharmaceutical 
violations. For the purposes of this work, we are interested in the second column, 
Parent Company, which contains the name of the pharmaceutical company in 
question.

You are a data scientist / AI engineer whose client wishes to gain further insight into 
clinical trials. You are tasked with answering these questions, using visualisations where 
these would support your conclusions.
You should address the following questions. 
1. The number of studies in the dataset. You must ensure that you explicitly check 
distinct studies.
2. You should list all the types (as contained in the Type column) of studies in the 
dataset along with the frequencies of each type. These should be ordered from 
most frequent to least frequent.
3. The top 5 conditions (from Conditions) with their frequencies.
4. Find the 10 most common sponsors that are not pharmaceutical companies, along 
with the number of clinical trials they have sponsored. Hint: For a basic 
implementation, you can assume that the Parent Company column contains all 
possible pharmaceutical companies.
5. Plot number of completed studies for each month in 2023. You need to include your 
visualization as well as a table of all the values you have plotted for each month.
You are to implement all 5 tasks 3 times: once in Spark SQL and twice in PySpark (once
in RDD and another time in DataFrame).
For the visualisation of the results, you are free to use any tool that fulfils the requirements, 
which can be tools such as Pythonâ€™s matplotlib, Excel, Power Bi, Tableau, or any other free 
open-source tool you may find suitable. Using built-in visualizations directly is permitted, 
it will however not yield a high number of marks. Your report needs to state the software 
used to generate the visualization, otherwise a built-in visualization will be assumed.
